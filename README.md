# 107-1  Special Topics on Advanced Software Development 
The repository contains the in-class practice and the take-home project for the NTU course "Special Topics on Advanced Software Development " (STASD) in 107-1 semester. The dataset from 91App is used as the course material in order to form the sense of data analysis and the know-how for the New Retail.  The basic skills for the data producing, mining, and wrangling such as web crawler, text mining, Apriori algorithm, machine learning and data visualization are introduced in the following lectures.

## Getting Started 

For those who may want to replicate the work or take them for reference, you can simply go through the steps below:

### Step 1 . Clone the repository

You can do this manually by download a zipped copy of the files using the "Clone or download" button or with the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/kevinkevin556/STASD myproject 
cd myproject
```

### Step 2.  Set up for the 91App dataset

All pieces of my project read the dataset from the directory `91APPdataset/`, and thus the relative dataset should be added under this folder to make sure all the scripts can run correctly. The other way is to modify the file path in the scripts separately.
